# Pick and Place Automation Using Cobot Arm with Vision-Based Color Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing a **vision-based pick-and-place system** using a **Collaborative Robot Arm (Cobot Arm 280)**.

The system autonomously identifies colored objects using a camera and places them into their respective **color-coded baskets**.

## Project Aim

To develop an automated pick-and-place solution where the cobot arm:

* Detects objects based on **color**
* Picks them using a **gripper mechanism**
* Places them accurately into corresponding **color baskets**

---

## Technical Objectives & Learning Outcomes

During this project, you will gain hands-on experience in:

* Industrial and Collaborative Robotics
* Robot Arm Kinematics & Motion Planning
* Vision-Based Automation using OpenCV
* Hardware–Software Integration

## Software Requirement

To enable communication with the Cobot Arm 280, you need to install the required Python library:

```bash
pip install pymycobot --upgrade
```

## Project Deliverables

By the end of the project, you are expected to successfully demonstrate the following:

### 1️Pick and Place Using Cobot Arm 280

* Accurate movement between pick and place locations
* Smooth and repeatable operation
